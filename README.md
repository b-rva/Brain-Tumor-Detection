# Brain-Tumor-Detection
The Brain Tumor Detection Project is a deep learning-based application designed to classify MRI brain scans into four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, No Tumor, and Pituitary tumors. The main goal of this project is to assist in the early and accurate diagnosis of brain tumors, potentially helping medical professionals make more informed decisions.
